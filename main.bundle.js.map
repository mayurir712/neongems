The founders of Neon Gems, Nirmal and Neena Jain, came from overseas with the skillset and drive to craft the finest jewelry. Based in Los Angeles, Neon Gems makes occasions memorable—from weddings to beautiful engagements, any joyous occasion, Neon Gems can be part of the celebration—pouring love into each and every piece. Here at Neon Gems, we make you sparkle. \\n\\nWe are a one-stop-shop for fine jewelry. Our foundation is built on refined skill, exemplary service, and ultimate sourcing. Each and every piece is crafted with soul, dedication, and precision. Our aim is to design timeless pieces of art that can be passed down from one generation to another, with a compelling and heartfelt story attached to it. \\n\\nTogether, we have perfected this art form and take great pride in our ability to discern impeccable quality and acquire the purest diamonds from the best sources worldwide. In doing so, we have had the honor of receiving the JCK Jeweler’s Choice Awards in 2015, 2017, 2018 & a finalist spot in 2016. \\n\\nOur jewelry, like fine wine, gains value as it ages. At Neon Gems, we consistently strive to foster a strong and warm rapport with our customers. Our success is intertwined with our customers’ delight. \\n\\n“We can never sell a piece that we are not 110% happy with,” the cofounders contend. Every piece of jewelry is like a biography—it has its own story to tell.
